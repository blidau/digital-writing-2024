   - Quality of the developed creative work
3. Annotations
   - Critical engagement with works of electronic literature that were read and discussed in class
   - Critical engagement with the readings
   - Developed creative work as a critical engagement with the form 
4. Reflection
   - Your artist statement
   - Reflection on the class and how your practice has developed
   - Reflections on the class exercises
   - Reflection on the developed creative work
5. Presentation

Ensure that you read the [digital writing folio assessment description in the course handbook](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/130722/pages/class-handbook-digital-writing).

Try to capture as much as you can in your folio. If you had a few iterations of your final project or experimented with techniques you did not use in your final piece; the folio is the place to record this with reflections and/or links to the experiments.

For the submission to Canvas, the document should include:

- Your name
- An artist statement (if this is already included in an artist CV or your website, still have it here, but it can be the same).
- A 500-word reflection on the class and how your practice has developed (if this is included in your GitHub digital writing folio, still have it here too).
- An artist CV or a link to a website that conveys similar information (e.g. artist bio and publications).
- A link to your GitHub account and your digital writing folio GitHub repository. Your folio repository should have links to your digital experiments and short reflections on those experiments.
- Screenshots and links to your digital experiments.
- Additional pages to your submission document, which include your reflections on your community of practice and experiences workshopping your creative project if these are not included in your folio repository.
- Any documentation on the development of your creative work with any scans of any designs and notes.
- [Coversheet for your developed creative work](./coversheet-for-developed-creative-work.md)
