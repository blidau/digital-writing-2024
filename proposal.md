# Proposal

Present (5-8 minutes) your creative work-in-progress to an audience of your peers who will provide professional feedback on how to develop your work. This must include an early prototype, a proposal for the final length of the work and at least 4 pages of design or text, presented as a slideshow e.g. Powerpoint, narrated and contextualised by you.

Some other questions you should try to answer in your proposals:
- Who is the intended audience for the piece?
- How do the digital aspects contribute meaningfully to the piece?
- How does the work relate to your creative practice?

Afterwards, please upload your presentation and supporting materials to Canvas.

See Canvas for [further details and the rubric for the assessment](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/130722/assignments/922769).
