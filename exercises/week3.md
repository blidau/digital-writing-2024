# Week 3

## Defining Electronic Literature

Edit the `exercises.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
- How are those elements meaningful?
- How are the works read differently from print literature?
- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

## Algorithm and Constraint

### Pen and Paper

Use pen and paper in applying the following processes and constraints. Take a photo of the results or transcribe them and add them to your folio.

#### To Make a Dadaist Poem

Follow the instructions for Tristan Tzara's ["To Make a Dadaist Poem"](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html).

#### Lipograms

Rewrite a very short piece of writing for each of the following constraints:

- The letter e
- Any other letter
- All the following letters: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y (prisoner's constraint)

#### Mesostics

Decide on a mesostic word. Rewrite a short piece of writing using this word as the spine word.

#### N+7

Replace every noun in a short piece of writing with the seventh noun that is found after it in a dictionary.

Vary this technique (e.g. N+9).

#### Constraint and Process

- Create a constraint (a restriction on your writing such as not using a letter (lipogram) or using a set number of syllables)
- Create a process (a process for creating writing such as picking the third word of each page of a book)
