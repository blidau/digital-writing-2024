# Week 1

## Questions

### Digital Writing

- What do you think digital writing is?
- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

### Reading

Read a few works from each volume of the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/):

* [Volume 1 (October 2006)](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/)
* [Volume 2 (February 2011)](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/)
* [Volume 3 (February 2016)](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/)
* [Volume 4 (June 2022)](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/)

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)

## GitHub

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Digital Writing Folio

Create a public repository with a `README` called `digital-writing-folio`.

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `readings.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `exercises.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/blidau/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md". You should see a button that looks like "<>" just above the content. Select that button to see the formatting on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages if you need to see the formatting used. Also read the reference for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Edit the `exercises.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions, you answered earlier.

## Write a Bio Note

Write a 100-word biographical note. Use the questions you answered above as starting points. Add the biographical note to the `README.md` of your GitHub digital writing folio repository.
